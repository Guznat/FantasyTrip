Hello! Thank you for downloading the Floating Skull Enemy. Here are a few pointers to help you navigate and make sense of this zip file.

- In the root folder, you will find folders corresponding to each color style for the skull enemy.

- In any of the style folders, you will find a folder named PNG. This folder contains the animation frames as individual PNGs.

- In the style folders, you will also find a folder named spritesheet. This folder contains the spritesheet for that style as well as a metadata file for parsing the spritesheet.

- The recommended frame duration is 0.1 seconds / frame (10 FPS)

Any questions?
Email me at contact@untiedgames.com and I'll try to answer as best I can!

-Will
