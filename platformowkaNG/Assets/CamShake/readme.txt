CamShake V0.1

CamShake is a handy set of C# scripts to make camera shaking effects.
Actually it can be used to shake any game object.
WHCameraShake.cs is used to shake an object in one direction and one rotation.
By combining several objects with WHCameraShake.cs in a row, you can make a variety of shaking effects.
Simple movements together make a complicated movement.
WHCameraRandomShaker.cs is used to make several WHCameraShake components to work together. It will automatically find WHCameraShake components in its transform hierarchy.
When running your game in editor, you can test your shaking effects by simply disable/enable WHCameraShake components.
